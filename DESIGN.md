# MeetingBuddy design system and UI plan

Status: **revision 2, decisions applied** (see §10). Nothing in `src/` has been changed yet. This document is the contract for the UI rebuild. Implementation starts only after it is approved.

## 0. Sources and scope

**What the redesign covers:** the whole renderer (`src/renderer/src`), which today is five files plus one 117-line `styles.css`:

| File | Today |
|---|---|
| `App.tsx` | App shell, sidebar, recording bar, banners, home empty state, Start recording and New project dialogs, all recording control logic |
| `ProjectView.tsx` | Project header, 4 tabs (Project state board, Meetings, Stakeholders, Change history), Edit project, Item editor with history, Paste transcript |
| `MeetingView.tsx` | Meeting header, transcript pane, Impact Report with proposal cards, Edit proposal, Map speakers, Rename |
| `SettingsView.tsx` | AI model, Speech-to-text, Detection and hotkeys |
| `ui.tsx` | `useAction`, `Modal`, `clickable`, `Field`, `ErrorBox`, `useTick`, `useEvent` |

The main process, IPC, preload and data model are **out of scope**. The rebuild uses the existing `api` proxy and `MainEvents` as they are. The only exception is the **theme setting** (§2, §9 Step 0): one new `theme` field in `Settings`/`SETTINGS_FIELDS`, plus `nativeTheme.themeSource` and the window background colour in `index.ts`.

**Figma inspiration:** *Meeting Notes & Productivity Dashboard UI Kit* ("MeetMind AI").
- Inspected: the full variable set (colours, Geist type styles, padding, radius, shadow), the component page structure, and screenshots of the cover (6 dashboard screens as thumbnails) and of the Sidebar/Header components.
- The file has only two pages: a cover and a component library. There are no full-size screen frames, so screen layouts here are adapted from the cover thumbnails and component specs, not copied.
- Screenshots of the Buttons, Badge, Input and Table frames were blocked by the Figma Starter-plan MCP rate limit. Their variant names and tokens were read, so their specs below come from those.

**Use of the kit:** inspiration only. We take its calm light-neutral surfaces, Geist typography, green brand colour, soft-tinted badges, 32/36/40 control sizes, and sidebar/top-bar structure. Its features (playlists, coaching, deals, upgrade plans, voice agents) don't exist in MeetingBuddy and are not carried over.

## 1. Design principles

MeetingBuddy answers one question: *what changed in the project because of this meeting?* The UI should make that question, and its evidence, the most visible thing on every screen.

1. **The project state is the hero, not the meeting.** Meetings are inputs; the board of requirements, decisions, tasks, risks, deadlines and questions is the output. Navigation, colour and hierarchy all point back to the state and to how a meeting changes it.
2. **Evidence is always one click away.** Every proposed change shows its verbatim quote, the speaker and the timestamp. Clicking a quote jumps to the transcript line. Quotes get a distinct, recognisable treatment (§4 `EvidenceQuote`) that is never decorative.
3. **Calm by default, loud only when action is needed.** Neutral, near-white surfaces with one brand colour. Colour is reserved for meaning: a type of item, the kind of change, a status that needs the user. Recording is the only element allowed to pulse.
4. **Review is a workflow, not a page.** The Impact Report is a queue: see a proposal, check the evidence, then accept, edit or reject it, and finally apply. Progress (pending / accepted / rejected) is always visible, and the Apply step is always in the same place.
5. **Trust through explicitness.** Destructive and state-removing actions (delete, close, supersede, apply) are labelled plainly and confirmed in-app. Errors say what happened and what to do next, and never disappear on their own.
6. **Desktop-native density.** This is a work tool used for hours on a laptop. Use 14 px body text, 36 px default controls and compact lists, and make it keyboard-first. It is not a marketing site.

**Look and feel:** light, airy and precise. White cards on an off-white canvas, hairline borders, almost no shadow, Geist type with slight negative tracking, a confident green accent and soft-tinted pill badges. Dark mode is a first-class peer, not an afterthought, because people record meetings at any hour and the current app is dark-only.

**Why light-first:** the Figma kit is light, and long reading sessions (transcripts, reports) favour dark-on-light. We follow the OS setting by default (`prefers-color-scheme`) and allow an override in Settings, so current dark-mode users keep dark.

---

## 2. Design tokens

Tokens are defined once, as CSS custom properties, in `src/renderer/src/styles/tokens.css`. They are exposed to **Tailwind CSS v4** through its `@theme` block (§5.1), so every token below is also a utility class:

| Token | Tailwind utility |
|---|---|
| `--color-surface` | `bg-surface` |
| `--color-fg-secondary` | `text-fg-secondary` |
| `--text-title` | `text-title` (size, line height and weight together) |
| `--radius-xl` | `rounded-xl` |
| 16 px spacing | `p-4`: Tailwind's default 4 px spacing scale already matches the kit (§2.4) |

Components use **semantic tokens only** (`bg-surface`, `text-danger-fg`), never raw palette values (`bg-gray-100`) or arbitrary hex (`bg-[#f1f1f1]`). Tailwind's default colour palette is removed in `@theme` (`--color-*: initial`), so a raw colour utility doesn't exist and can't be typed by mistake. Themes swap the semantic layer.

**Theme selection** has three options: **System (default)**, Light and Dark.
- The choice is stored as a new `theme: 'system' | 'light' | 'dark'` setting in `settings.json`. That means adding it to `Settings`, `SETTINGS_FIELDS` and the defaults.
- Main applies it with `nativeTheme.themeSource = settings.theme`. Chromium then reports the matching `prefers-color-scheme` to the renderer, and main also sets the window `backgroundColor` from `nativeTheme.shouldUseDarkColors`, so there's no white or black flash at launch.
- The CSS keys off that one signal: semantic tokens are redefined under `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`, and Tailwind's `dark:` variant uses the same media query, which is Tailwind v4's default.
- When the user picks "System", Windows' own light/dark switch takes effect live, with no JS involved.
- `useTheme()` only reads and writes the setting through the existing `api.getSettings`/`api.saveSettings`.

### 2.1 Palette (raw, from Figma unless marked *derived*)

Values marked *derived* aren't in the kit. They were added to reach WCAG AA where the kit's own tone fails (see §8.1).

**Neutral**

| Token | Hex | Figma name |
|---|---|---|
| `--gray-0` | `#ffffff` | General/white, bg-secondary |
| `--gray-25` | `#fafafa` | bg-primary-hover |
| `--gray-50` | `#f9f9f9` | bg-primary |
| `--gray-100` | `#f1f1f1` | Gray/100, bg-secondary-hover |
| `--gray-200` | `#e9e9e9` | Gray/200, border-secondary |
| `--gray-300` | `#e5e5e5` | Gray/300, border-primary, bg-disabled |
| `--gray-400` | `#d4d4d4` | *derived* (input borders) |
| `--gray-500` | `#8e8e8e` | Icon/disabled, border-focused |
| `--gray-600` | `#696e6e` | *derived* from Text/disabled `#717676` (that one fails 4.5:1 on `#f9f9f9`) |
| `--gray-700` | `#575757` | Text/tertiary |
| `--gray-800` | `#373737` | Icon/secondary |
| `--gray-850` | `#2d2d2d` | Text/secondary |
| `--gray-900` | `#111111` | Gray/900, Icon/primary |
| `--gray-950` | `#000000` | Gray/950 |

**Brand green**

| Token | Hex | Figma name |
|---|---|---|
| `--green-50` | `#e6f5ef` | Badge/Primary-shade |
| `--green-100` | `#ccebdf` | Primary/50 |
| `--green-200` | `#b3e2cf` | Primary/100 |
| `--green-300` | `#66c49e` | Primary/300 |
| `--green-400` | `#33b17e` | Primary/400 |
| `--green-500` | `#009d5e` | Primary/500, Button/primary |
| `--green-600` | `#007e4b` | Primary/600 |
| `--green-700` | `#006640` | *derived* (hover/pressed) |
| `--green-900` | `#002f1c` | Primary/900 |

> **Key decision:** the kit fills primary buttons with `#009d5e`. White 14 px text on it is only about **3.5:1**, which fails AA. Our primary fill is **`--green-600` `#007e4b` (about 5.1:1)**. `#009d5e` is kept for non-text brand marks: logo, focus ring, progress fill, the selected sidebar indicator. Those need 3:1 and pass.

**Accent hues.** Each hue has four tokens:
- `soft`: a tinted background
- `border`
- `text`: text on `soft`, ≥ 4.5:1
- `solid`: a filled background with white text, ≥ 4.5:1

| Hue | soft | border | text | solid | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| red | `#f9ebeb` | `#e8aeae` | `#9e2a2a` | `#c63435` | Badge/Red*, Red/600 |
| green | `#edf6f3` | `#b5ddcd` | `#1f6b4e` *d* | `#007e4b` | Badge/success* |
| yellow | `#fff8ec` | `#ffe3b4` | `#5f4314` | `#ffb844` (dark text `#3d2a07`) | Badge/Yellow*, Yellow/900 |
| blue | `#e8f3fd` | `#a1d1f5` | `#175ba8` *d* | `#1f6fd1` *d* | Badge/Blue* |
| purple | `#f6e9fe` | `#dba8fa` | `#6f19a6` *d* | `#831ec2` | Badge/Purple*, Purple/600 |
| pink | `#ffedff` | `#ffb9fe` | `#8f1f8c` *d* | `#b02bad` *d* | Badge/Pink* |
| orange | `#fef2e9` | `#fbcba7` | `#94480f` *d* | `#ad5518` *d* | Badge/Orange* |
| teal | `#ecfafd` | `#b1eaf6` | `#1d6575` *d* | `#237a8c` *d* | Badge/Teal* |
| neutral | `#f1f1f1` | `#e5e5e5` | `#373737` | `#111111` | Badge/black* |

### 2.2 Semantic colour tokens

Names are chosen to read well as Tailwind utilities: `--color-surface` becomes `bg-surface`, `--color-fg-secondary` becomes `text-fg-secondary`, and `--color-line` becomes `border-line`.

| Token | Utility example | Light | Dark | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--color-canvas` | `bg-canvas` | gray-50 `#f9f9f9` | `#0e0f0f` | Window canvas |
| `--color-surface` | `bg-surface` | gray-0 `#ffffff` | `#161717` | Cards, sidebar, dialogs |
| `--color-raised` | `bg-raised` | gray-0 | `#1d1e1f` | Menus, popovers, toasts |
| `--color-hover` | `hover:bg-hover` | gray-25 `#fafafa` | `#222324` | Row/item hover |
| `--color-selected` | `bg-selected` | gray-100 `#f1f1f1` | `#26282a` | Selected nav item, pressed ghost button |
| `--color-inset` | `bg-inset` | gray-50 | `#121313` | Transcript well, kbd |
| `--color-disabled` | `bg-disabled` | gray-300 | `#232425` | Disabled controls |
| `--color-line` | `border-line` | gray-200 `#e9e9e9` | `#2b2c2e` | Card/section hairlines |
| `--color-line-strong` | `border-line-strong` | gray-400 `#d4d4d4` | `#3a3c3e` | Inputs, stroke buttons |
| `--color-line-hover` | `hover:border-line-hover` | gray-500 `#8e8e8e` | `#6b6e72` | Input hover |
| `--color-fg` | `text-fg` | gray-900 `#111111` | `#ededed` | Primary text |
| `--color-fg-secondary` | `text-fg-secondary` | gray-700 `#575757` | `#a3a3a3` | Meta, labels |
| `--color-fg-tertiary` | `text-fg-tertiary` | gray-600 `#696e6e` | `#8a8a8a` | Hints, timestamps |
| `--color-fg-disabled` | `text-fg-disabled` | gray-500 | `#5f6163` | Disabled labels (exempt from contrast) |
| `--color-fg-inverse` | `text-fg-inverse` | `#ffffff` | `#04140d` | Text on accent/solid fills |
| `--color-icon` | `text-icon` | gray-800 | `#c9c9c9` | Default icon |
| `--color-accent` | `bg-accent` | green-600 `#007e4b` | green-400 `#33b17e` | Primary button fill |
| `--color-accent-hover` | `hover:bg-accent-hover` | green-700 | green-300 | |
| `--color-accent-soft` | `bg-accent-soft` | green-50 | `rgb(51 177 126 / .14)` | Soft primary button, selected chips |
| `--color-accent-fg` | `text-accent-fg` | green-600 | `#4fc492` | Links, accent text on surfaces |
| `--color-brand` | `bg-brand` | green-500 `#009d5e` | green-400 | Logo, progress, selected indicator |
| `--color-focus` | `ring-focus` | green-500 | green-400 | Focus ring |
| `--color-overlay` | `bg-overlay` | `rgb(17 17 17 / .40)` | `rgb(0 0 0 / .60)` | Dialog backdrop |

**State colours.** Each has `-soft`, `-line`, `-fg`, `-solid` and `-on` (light values from §2.1's soft/border/text/solid columns; `-on` is the text colour on `-solid`: white, except dark brown on yellow and near-black on dark-mode green). Examples: `bg-danger-soft`, `border-danger-line`, `text-danger-fg`, `bg-danger-solid`.

| Role | Hue | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-success-*` | green | Accepted proposal, Applied, saved, `create` op |
| `--color-warning-*` | yellow | Needs review, tentative, `supersede` op, skipped changes |
| `--color-danger-*` | red | Errors, delete, conflict/`flag` op, high impact |
| `--color-info-*` | blue | Processing/analyzing, `update` op, informational banners |
| `--color-record-*` | red | Recording only. Same hue as danger, but a separate token so recording UI can diverge later. |

The categorical hues (blue, purple, teal, orange, pink, plus red, green, yellow and neutral) get the same four tokens: `--color-blue-soft`, `--color-blue-line`, `--color-blue-fg` and `--color-blue-solid`, and likewise for the rest. They are used only through the domain badge components (§4.3).

In dark mode:
- `-soft` is the hue at 14% alpha over the surface, and `-line` at 35%.
- `-fg` uses light tones: red `#f08b8b`, green `#5fd3a2`, yellow `#ffc966`, blue `#79b8ff`, purple `#c792f5`, pink `#ff8bfd`, orange `#f7a065`, teal `#6fdaf0`.
- `-solid` keeps the light-mode value, except green, which becomes green-400 with dark text.

**Domain colour mapping.** This is categorical, so it is never the only cue: a label or icon always accompanies the colour.

| Domain value | Hue | Icon (lucide name) |
|---|---|---|
| Item `requirement` | blue | `list-checks` |
| Item `decision` | purple | `gavel` |
| Item `task` | teal | `square-check` |
| Item `risk` | red | `triangle-alert` |
| Item `deadline` | orange | `calendar-clock` |
| Item `question` | pink | `circle-help` |
| Op `create` → "New" | green | `plus` |
| Op `update` → "Change" | blue | `pencil` |
| Op `close` → "Close" | neutral | `circle-check` |
| Op `supersede` → "Replaces" | yellow | `replace` |
| Op `flag` → "Conflict" | red | `zap` |
| Meeting `recording` | record (with pulsing dot) | `mic` |
| Meeting `transcribing` / `analyzing` | info (with spinner) | `loader` |
| Meeting `ready` | neutral | `file-text` |
| Meeting `analyzed` → "Needs review" | warning | `inbox` |
| Meeting `applied` | success | `check` |
| Impact `high` / `medium` / `low` | danger / warning / neutral | none |

**Speaker colours.** Avatars and transcript speaker names take a stable hue from `hash(speaker) % 8` over blue, purple, teal, orange, pink, green, yellow and neutral, using the `-fg` tone on the `-soft` tone. The local user (`settings.selfName`) is always green.

### 2.3 Typography

**Family:** **Geist** (UI) and **Geist Mono** (timestamps, kbd, version numbers, short refs).
- Both come from `@fontsource-variable/geist` and `@fontsource-variable/geist-mono` (OFL), imported in `styles/index.css`. Vite bundles the `woff2` files into the app, which the renderer CSP (`default-src 'self'`) requires; no Google Fonts.
- Each subset is a separate file with a `unicode-range`, so only the subsets a page actually uses are loaded. Italics aren't imported (§4.3 `EvidenceQuote` doesn't use them).
- Fallback: `"Segoe UI Variable", "Segoe UI", system-ui, sans-serif`.
- Numerals use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` wherever they change in place (timers, counts, confidence).

The scale follows the kit (12/14/16/18/20) and adds two display steps for page titles.

| Token | Size / line height | Weight | Tracking | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--text-display` | 28 / 34 | 600 | -0.02em | Empty-state and onboarding headline |
| `--text-title` | 22 / 28 | 600 | -0.02em | Page title (`PageHeader`) |
| `--text-heading` | 18 / 24 | 600 | -0.015em | Section headings, dialog titles |
| `--text-subheading` | 16 / 22 | 600 | -0.01em | Card titles, report group headings |
| `--text-body` | 14 / 20 | 400 | -0.005em | Default UI and body text |
| `--text-body-strong` | 14 / 20 | 500 | -0.005em | Buttons, nav items, item titles |
| `--text-reading` | 15 / 24 | 400 | 0 | Transcript lines, summary, quotes (longer reading) |
| `--text-small` | 12 / 16 | 400 or 500 | 0 | Meta, badges, labels, hints |
| `--text-mono` | 12 / 16 | 400 | 0 | Timestamps, kbd, `v3` |

In Tailwind, each step is one `@theme` font-size token, with its line height, weight and tracking set in the same place (for example `--text-title--line-height` and `--text-title--font-weight`). One class such as `text-title` therefore applies the whole style. `--font-sans` is Geist and `--font-mono` is Geist Mono.

Weights: 400 regular, 500 medium, 600 semibold. **No 700**: Geist at 600 is heavy enough, and fewer weights means less font weight to load. The kit's "-2" tracking is -2%, and we only apply it at 16 px and above.

### 2.4 Spacing (4 px base; names follow the kit's `Padding/*`)

We use Tailwind's default spacing scale unchanged: `--spacing: 4px`, so `p-1` = 4 px and `gap-3` = 12 px. It matches the kit's padding tokens exactly, so there are no custom spacing tokens. Use only the steps below; Biome can't enforce this, so code review must.

| Kit name | px | Tailwind | Typical use |
|---|---|---|---|
| | 2 | `0.5` | Icon/text optical nudge |
| xxs | 4 | `1` | Badge padding-y, tight gaps |
| xs | 8 | `2` | Gap between inline controls, icon–label |
| sm | 12 | `3` | Compact card padding, list row padding |
| md | 16 | `4` | Card padding, stack gap |
| lg | 20 | `5` | Section gap |
| xl | 24 | `6` | Page gutter, dialog padding |
| | 32 | `8` | Page section separation |
| | 40 | `10` | Empty-state padding |
| | 64 | `16` | Onboarding hero |

### 2.5 Radius

| Token | px | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--radius-xs` | 4 | kbd, checkbox, small chips |
| `--radius-sm` | 6 | Badges, sm buttons, tooltips |
| `--radius-md` | 8 | Buttons, nav items, menu items (kit `Radius/s`) |
| `--radius-lg` | 10 | Inputs, selects, textareas (kit `Radius/m`) |
| `--radius-xl` | 12 | Cards, board columns, proposal cards (kit `Radius/l`) |
| `--radius-2xl` | 16 | Dialogs, toasts |
| `--radius-full` | 999 | Avatars, status dots, switch, pill badges |

### 2.6 Elevation

Elevation is mostly expressed by surface colour and a hairline border. Shadows are rare and soft.

| Token | Light | Dark | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--shadow-xs` | `0 1px 2px rgb(9 25 72 / .06)` (kit "Shadow") | none | Cards, stroke buttons |
| `--shadow-sm` | `0 2px 6px rgb(9 25 72 / .06), 0 1px 2px rgb(9 25 72 / .04)` | `0 0 0 1px #2b2c2e` | Hovered interactive cards |
| `--shadow-md` | `0 8px 24px rgb(9 25 72 / .10), 0 2px 6px rgb(9 25 72 / .06)` | `0 8px 24px rgb(0 0 0 / .5), 0 0 0 1px #2b2c2e` | Menus, popovers, toasts |
| `--shadow-lg` | `0 24px 64px rgb(9 25 72 / .18)` | `0 24px 64px rgb(0 0 0 / .6), 0 0 0 1px #2b2c2e` | Dialogs |
| `--shadow-focus` | `0 0 0 2px var(--color-surface), 0 0 0 4px var(--color-focus)` | same | Focus ring (§8.3) |

**Z-index:**

| Layer | Value |
|---|---|
| `--z-sticky` | 10 |
| `--z-sidebar` | 20 |
| `--z-dropdown` | 30 |
| `--z-banner` | 40 |
| `--z-overlay` | 50 |
| `--z-dialog` | 60 |
| `--z-toast` | 70 |
| `--z-tooltip` | 80 |

### 2.7 Sizing

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| `--control-sm` | 32 px (kit Small) |
| `--control-md` | 36 px (kit Medium; default) |
| `--control-lg` | 40 px (kit Large; primary CTAs in dialogs and empty states) |
| `--icon-sm` / `--icon-md` / `--icon-lg` | 16 / 18 / 20 px |
| `--sidebar-w` | 248 px |
| `--sidebar-rail-w` | 64 px |
| `--topbar-h` | 56 px |
| `--content-max` | 1440 px |
| `--reading-max` | 760 px (Stakeholders, History, Settings forms) |

### 2.8 Breakpoints

This is an Electron window, so the breakpoints are window widths. `BrowserWindow` has `minWidth: 900` and a default of 1280×820.

| Name | Range | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `compact` | 900–1099 px | Sidebar collapses to the icon rail. The meeting page shows Transcript/Report as tabs, not a split. The board has 2 columns. |
| `regular` | 1100–1439 px | Full sidebar. The meeting page is split 5:7. The board has 3 columns. |
| `wide` | ≥ 1440 px | Content is capped at `--content-max` and centred. The board has 3 columns with more breathing room (6 columns is too narrow for card text). |

In Tailwind they are the `regular:` and `wide:` variants (§5.1). Styles are written compact-first: unprefixed classes are the compact layout, and `regular:` / `wide:` add to them. JS reads the breakpoints only where the component tree has to change (split → tabs), through `useMediaQuery`.

### 2.9 Motion tokens

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| `--dur-instant` | 80 ms (press feedback) |
| `--dur-fast` | 120 ms (hover, colour changes) |
| `--dur-base` | 180 ms (menus, tooltips, accordion) |
| `--dur-slow` | 260 ms (dialogs, toasts) |
| `--ease-out` | `cubic-bezier(.2, .8, .2, 1)` (enter) |
| `--ease-in` | `cubic-bezier(.4, 0, 1, 1)` (exit) |
| `--ease-standard` | `cubic-bezier(.4, 0, .2, 1)` (move/resize) |

                                                        ToastRegion (bottom-right)
```

- **Sidebar** (`--color-surface`, right hairline): `Brand`, then the **Projects** section (list with a "+" icon button), then a spacer, then an **Others** section (Settings), then `SetupCard`.
  - This follows the kit's "Main Menu / Others / Upgrade card" structure. The upgrade card becomes a **setup checklist card**: it shows when no LLM key or no STT provider is configured, and otherwise collapses to a hotkey hint (`Ctrl+Shift+R to record`).
  - In `compact` mode it becomes a 64 px rail: brand mark, project initials as avatar buttons with tooltips, and the settings icon.
- **TopBar** (light surface, bottom hairline, not the kit's dark navy bar: we keep chrome calm and reserve strong colour for recording):
  - Left: breadcrumbs (`Apollo › Meetings › Weekly sync`).
  - Right: the **Capture** split button, adapted from the kit's "Capture ▾". Its main action is "Record meeting" and its menu has "Paste transcript…", "Import transcript file…" and "Import recording…".
  - While recording, Capture is replaced by the **RecordingPill**: pulsing dot, title, timer, Mark moment, Stop. The current full-width red recording bar goes away, but the recording state is still impossible to miss.
- **BannerStack**: persistent, dismissable notices that need a decision (meeting detected → Record / Ignore). Transient messages ("Recording saved…") move to **toasts**.
- **Content**: `p-6` (24 px), `max-width: var(--content-max)`, centred. Each page owns its own scroll, except the meeting page, whose two panes scroll independently.

### 3.2 Page anatomy

```
PageHeader
  [Back link?]  Title (text-title)            [Secondary actions] [Primary action]
  Meta line (text-small, secondary): dates, counts, status badge
Tabs (optional, project pages)
Toolbar (optional): filters, toggles, counts               [Page-level actions]
Body
```

### 3.3 Grid

- **Base unit: 4 px.** All spacing and sizes are multiples of 4, and most are multiples of 8.
- There is no global 12-column grid. Pages are tool-shaped, so each body uses one of three layouts:
  1. **Board:** `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr)); gap: 16px`. With six item-type columns this gives 3×2 at `regular`/`wide` and 2×3 at `compact`.
  2. **Split** (meeting page): `grid-template-columns: minmax(360px, 5fr) 7fr; gap: 20px`. Both panes are `height: calc(100vh - topbar - header)` with their own scroll. At `compact` it becomes `Tabs` with Transcript / Impact report.
  3. **Reading column** (Stakeholders, History, Settings): a single column at `max-width: var(--reading-max)`. Settings adds a 200 px sticky section nav on the left at `regular`+ (from the kit's Settings "General / Meeting Settings…" sub-nav).

### 3.4 Responsive behaviour summary

| Element | compact (900–1099) | regular (1100–1439) | wide (≥1440) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sidebar | 64 px rail + tooltips | 248 px | 248 px |
| TopBar breadcrumbs | Last 2 crumbs | Full | Full |
| Board | 2 cols | 3 cols | 3 cols, centred |
| Meeting page | Tabs | Split 5:7 | Split 5:7, capped |
| Meetings table | Hides "Source" column | All columns | All columns |
| Settings | Section nav becomes top Tabs | Side nav | Side nav |
| Dialogs | `min(560px, 100vw - 48px)` | Same | Same |

## 4. Component inventory

Conventions for every component:
- A function component with typed props.
- `className` is forwarded and merged last through `cn()` (`clsx` + `tailwind-merge`), so a caller's `mt-4` wins over a component default. `...rest` is spread onto the root, so `aria-*` and `data-*` pass through.
- **Variants are declared with `class-variance-authority` (`cva`)**, the usual enterprise Tailwind pattern (shadcn/ui and similar), in a `*.variants.ts` file next to the component. Variant props are typed from the `cva` definition with `VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants>`, so a misspelt variant is a compile error.
- The component also sets `data-variant` / `data-size` / `data-state` on its root. Tests and the occasional parent selector (`group-data-[state=accepted]:`) can then target state without depending on utility class strings.
- No ad-hoc `className` soup in features: a class list that is repeated, or longer than about 8 utilities, becomes a variant or a small component.
- Interactive components use native elements (`<button>`, `<input>`, `<dialog>`) wherever possible.
- **Standard states:** default, hover, focus-visible, active/pressed, disabled, and loading where it applies. Disabled uses the `disabled` attribute, never only a class, and is styled as `bg-disabled` / `text-fg-disabled` with no opacity hacks, because those break contrast on dark mode.

### 4.1 Primitives (`components/ui/`)

#### Button

Maps to the kit's `Buttons [1.0]`: Type × Style × State × Size × Only Icon.

```ts
type ButtonProps = ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> & {
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'soft' | 'ghost' | 'danger' | 'danger-soft' | 'record'  // default 'secondary'
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'          // 32 / 36 / 40, default 'md'
  icon?: LucideIcon                   // leading icon, e.g. icon={Plus}
  iconRight?: LucideIcon
  loading?: boolean                   // shows Spinner in place of icon, sets aria-busy, disables
  fullWidth?: boolean
}
```

| Variant | Kit equivalent | Look |
|---|---|---|
| `primary` | Primary/Filled | `--color-accent` fill, inverse text |
| `secondary` | Neutral/Stroke | Surface fill, `--color-line-strong`, `--shadow-xs` |
| `soft` | Primary/Lighter | `--color-accent-soft` fill, accent text |
| `ghost` | Neutral/Ghost | Transparent, `--color-selected` on hover |
| `danger` | Error/Stroke | Surface fill, danger text and border |
| `danger-soft` | Error/Lighter | Danger-soft fill, danger text |
| `record` | (new) | Record-solid fill, white text, with a dot icon |

- States: hover darkens the fill by one step (or gets `--color-hover` for secondary/ghost); active translates 0.5 px down (`--dur-instant`); focus shows `--shadow-focus`; disabled uses disabled tokens with `cursor: not-allowed`.
- Loading keeps the width (the label stays, the icon becomes a spinner), so the layout doesn't jump. It is wired to `useAction().busy`.
- Text is sentence case, verb-first ("Apply 3 changes", not "Apply"). Text symbols like "✓" and "●" are replaced by real icons.

#### IconButton
`Button` with only an icon. It requires `label: string`, which becomes its `aria-label` and tooltip. Square, sizes sm/md/lg. Variants: `ghost` (default), `secondary`, `danger`.

#### SplitButton
A primary action plus a chevron that opens a `Menu`. Used by Capture. Props: `label`, `icon`, `onClick`, `items: MenuItem[]`, `variant`, `size`.

#### Icon
Icons come from **`lucide-react`**: outline icons on a 24 grid with `currentColor`, close to the kit's outline set. They are imported by name (`import { Mic } from 'lucide-react'`), so unused icons are tree-shaken.
- Components take icons as `LucideIcon` component props (`icon={Mic}`), never as strings.
- A thin `<Icon icon={Mic} size="sm|md|lg" label?>` wrapper applies our sizes (16/18/20 px), `strokeWidth={1.75}` and `aria-hidden` unless `label` is passed. Use it instead of rendering lucide components directly.
- The domain → icon mapping (§2.2) lives in `lib/labels.ts`, next to the labels, so it is defined once.

#### Badge
Maps to the kit's Badge: Color × Type (Filled / Outline + Shade / Shade / Outline).

```ts
type BadgeProps = {
  tone?: 'neutral' | 'accent' | 'success' | 'warning' | 'danger' | 'info' | 'blue' | 'purple' | 'teal' | 'orange' | 'pink' | 'red' | 'green' | 'yellow'
  appearance?: 'soft' | 'soft-outline' | 'outline' | 'solid'   // default 'soft-outline'
  size?: 'sm' | 'md'          // 20 / 24 px tall
  icon?: LucideIcon
  dot?: boolean               // leading status dot; `pulse` animates it (recording only)
  pulse?: boolean
  children: ReactNode
}
```

Badges aren't interactive. Domain wrappers (below) choose tone, icon and label so call sites can't drift: `ItemTypeBadge`, `OpBadge`, `MeetingStatusBadge`, `ImpactBadge`, `ItemStatusBadge`.

#### Input, Textarea, Select
Maps to the kit's Input Field and Text Area states: Default, Hover, Active/Focused, Typing, Filled, Disabled, Error.

```ts
type InputProps = InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement> & {
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'
  leading?: LucideIcon | ReactNode   // e.g. search icon
  trailing?: ReactNode             // e.g. Kbd, clear button, show/hide for keys
  invalid?: boolean                // sets aria-invalid, danger border
}
```

- `Textarea` adds `autoGrow?: boolean` and `minRows?`.
- `Select` is a styled native `<select>` with a chevron, for reliability and keyboard support. A custom listbox isn't needed.
- `SecretInput` is `Input type=password` with a show/hide `IconButton` (from the kit's Password type). It is used for API keys and never pre-filled.
- States:
  - border `--color-line-strong`
  - hover `--color-line-hover`
  - focus: accent border plus `--shadow-focus`
  - invalid: danger border, plus `text-danger-fg` helper text below
  - disabled: `--color-disabled`

#### Field
Wraps a control with its label, hint and error, and wires up `id`, `htmlFor` and `aria-describedby` automatically through `useId`. This replaces today's `<label className="field">`.

```ts
type FieldProps = { label: string; hint?: ReactNode; error?: string | null; required?: boolean; optional?: boolean; children: ReactElement }
```

#### Checkbox, Switch, Radio / RadioCardGroup
These map to the kit's Checkbox, Toggle and Radio.
- `Switch` is used for binary settings ("Detect meetings automatically", "Show done / superseded").
- `RadioCardGroup` is new, inspired by the kit's Integrations cards. It is used for choosing the LLM and STT provider: each option is a card with name, one-line hint and a "Key saved" badge. It is `role="radiogroup"` with arrow-key navigation.

#### Tabs
Maps to the kit's Tab Menu (horizontal, underline indicator).

```ts
type TabsProps = { value: string; onChange: (v: string) => void; items: { value: string; label: string; count?: number; icon?: LucideIcon }[]; size?: 'sm' | 'md' }
```

It uses the WAI-ARIA tabs pattern (`role=tablist/tab/tabpanel`, roving tabindex, ←/→ Home/End). `SegmentedControl` is a pill variant used for small toggles, such as the Transcript/Report switch at `compact` and the theme choice.

#### Card
`<Card padding="sm|md|lg" interactive? selected? as?>`: surface, hairline border, `--radius-xl`, `--shadow-xs`. `interactive` adds hover (`--shadow-sm` plus `--color-line-hover`) and must be paired with a button or `clickable()`.

#### Dialog
Replaces `Modal`. It is built on native `<dialog>` with `showModal()`, which gives focus trapping, inertness of the page behind, top-layer stacking and Escape to close for free.

```ts
type DialogProps = { open: boolean; onClose: () => void; title: string; description?: ReactNode; size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'; footer?: ReactNode; children: ReactNode; dismissible?: boolean /* false while saving */ }
```

- Widths: sm 420, md 560, lg 720.
- The header has the title and a close `IconButton`. The body scrolls. The footer is sticky, right-aligned, with the primary action rightmost; destructive actions sit far left.
- Focus goes to the first field or the primary button, and returns to the trigger on close.

#### ConfirmDialog
Replaces every `window.confirm` (5 call sites today).

```ts
confirm({ title, body, confirmLabel, tone: 'danger' | 'warning' | 'default' }): Promise<boolean>   // via useConfirm()
```

The confirm button names the action ("Delete project", not "OK"). For irreversible deletes, initial focus goes to **Cancel**.

#### Menu
A popover menu for SplitButton, row overflow (`…`) and the project context menu. `role="menu"`, arrow keys, typeahead, Escape returns focus.

```ts
type MenuItem = { label: string; icon?: LucideIcon; onSelect: () => void; disabled?: boolean; tone?: 'danger'; shortcut?: string }
```

#### Tooltip
Shown on hover after 500 ms, and immediately on focus. It is text-only and never holds essential information: anything essential is also in the label or `aria-label`. It is used for icon buttons, rail items, confidence %, and "why is this disabled" reasons (today these are `title=` attributes).

#### Toast / ToastRegion
Transient confirmations and background progress ("Recording saved. Transcribing in the background…").
- `useToast().show({ tone, title, body?, action? })`.
- Toasts are bottom-right and stack up to 3. They auto-dismiss after 6 s, which pauses on hover or focus. **Error toasts never auto-dismiss.**
- The region is `role="status"`, or `role="alert"` for errors.
- This replaces the current single `banner` string and its 9 s timeout.

#### Banner (InlineAlert)
A persistent message inside a page or the BannerStack.

```ts
type BannerProps = { tone: 'info' | 'success' | 'warning' | 'danger'; title?: string; children: ReactNode; actions?: ReactNode; onDismiss?: () => void }
```

It replaces `ErrorBox` and `.error`. Uses: the meeting error with "Transcribe recording", the skipped-changes list, the detected meeting, the "no STT provider" notice.

#### EmptyState
`{ icon, title, body, action?, secondaryAction? }`. Centred, with an icon in a soft circle, `--text-subheading` title and body max 420 px. Copy always says what to do next.

#### Skeleton
`<Skeleton width height radius>` plus presets `Skeleton.Text lines`, `Skeleton.Card` and `Skeleton.Row`. It has a shimmer (§7). This replaces `return null` while loading.

#### Spinner
16/20 px ring, `currentColor`, `role="status"` with `aria-label`.

#### ProgressBar
Determinate and indeterminate. It is used in `SetupCard` (setup steps done) and in `ReviewBar` (proposals reviewed / total). The kit's segmented "upgrade" progress style is used for `SetupCard`.

#### Avatar
`{ name, size: 'xs'|'sm'|'md', tone? }`. Initials in a coloured circle (speaker colour rule from §2.2). It is used for speakers, stakeholders, owners and projects (in rail mode).

#### Kbd
Keyboard shortcut chip. It renders `CommandOrControl` as `Ctrl` (this logic exists in `App.tsx` today).

#### Other small primitives
- `Divider`
- `VisuallyHidden`
- `Timestamp`: `{ seconds }` renders `fmtTime` in mono tabular; `{ iso }` renders `fmtDate` and puts the full date in a tooltip.
- `Stat`: a number and a label, used for the project summary strip, inspired by the kit's dashboard stat cards.

### 4.2 Layout components (`components/layout/`)

| Component | Props | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `AppShell` | `sidebar`, `topbar`, `banners`, `children` | CSS grid; owns the compact/regular switch |
| `Sidebar` | `projects`, `currentProjectId`, `onSelect`, `onNewProject`, `onSettings`, `active` | Collapses to a rail at `compact` |
| `SidebarSection` | `title`, `action?`, `children` | "Projects", "Others" |
| `SidebarItem` | `icon \| avatar`, `label`, `active`, `badge?`, `onClick` | A real `<button>`; `aria-current="page"` when active; kit Nav Items states |
| `SetupCard` | `settings` | Setup checklist / hotkey hint |
| `TopBar` | `breadcrumbs`, `right` | |
| `Breadcrumbs` | `items: { label, onClick? }[]` | `<nav aria-label="Breadcrumb">` |
| `PageHeader` | `title`, `meta?`, `back?`, `actions?`, `editableTitle?` | |
| `Toolbar` | `left`, `right` | |
| `SplitPane` | `left`, `right`, `compactTabs: [string, string]` | Splits into tabs at `compact` |
| `ScrollPane` | `children`, `label` | A labelled region with its own scroll and a gradient edge |

### 4.3 Feature components (`features/*`)

**Projects** (`features/projects/`)
- `ProjectSummaryStrip`: `Stat` × 3 ("12 open items", "2 meetings need review", "Last change 3 days ago"). It uses `listItems`, `listMeetings` and `listStateVersions`, which already exist.
- `NewProjectDialog` and `EditProjectDialog`. Delete moves into an explicit danger zone and uses `ConfirmDialog`.

**State board** (`features/board/`)
- `StateBoard { projectId }`: data loading plus the `meeting:changed` subscription.
- `BoardColumn { type, items, onAdd, onOpen }`: header with `ItemTypeBadge`, count and an add `IconButton`; it shows an empty hint in the column.
- `ItemCard { item, onOpen }`: title (2-line clamp), and a meta row with `Avatar` owner, due date (orange when within 7 days, red when past), and `v3` when the item has changed. Done, superseded and cancelled items are dimmed with an `ItemStatusBadge`. It is a real `<button>`.
- `ItemDialog { item | draft, onClose, onSaved }`: a popup (`Dialog`, size `lg`) with two sections:
  - The edit form: type, status, title, details, owner and due date.
  - Below it, the collapsible "History" timeline (`ItemHistory`). It is open by default when the item has history, so the evidence behind the item is visible without extra clicks.

  Delete sits far left in the footer and goes through `ConfirmDialog`. The dialog body scrolls while the footer stays fixed.
- `ItemHistory { entries }`: a vertical timeline. Each entry has a summary, meeting link, date and `EvidenceQuote`.

**Meetings list** (`features/meetings/`)
- `MeetingTable { meetings, onOpen }`, from the kit's Table Component. Columns are Title, Date, Source, Status and a "Needs attention" icon. Rows are buttons, sorted newest first. There is no pagination, because per-project lists are short.
- `CaptureMenu { projectId }`: the SplitButton. It owns the paste/file/audio import actions now in `Meetings`.
- `PasteTranscriptDialog`: keeps its current behaviour, where the pasted text is kept on failure.
- `MeetingStatusBadge`.

**Meeting page** (`features/meeting/`)
- `MeetingHeader`: back link, editable title, meta (date · source · N lines), `MeetingStatusBadge`, and actions (Map speakers, Analyze / Re-analyze, overflow `…` → Delete).
- `PipelineStepper`: `Captured → Transcribed → Analyzed → Reviewed → Applied`. It shows where the meeting is and what's next. The current step shows a spinner while it is processing, and an error marks its step in danger.
- `TranscriptPane { segments, marks, highlightId, live }`: a `ScrollPane` with a sticky speaker filter (chips) and an "N lines" count. When live, it auto-scrolls to the bottom unless the user has scrolled up; in that case a "Jump to latest" pill appears.
- `TranscriptLine { segment, marked, highlighted }`: a mono timestamp gutter, then a speaker `Avatar` and name, then text in `--text-reading`. A marked line has an amber left rail and a star icon. A highlighted line has a warning-soft background, which fades after 2 s.
- `ImpactReport`: `ReportSummary`, then `ProposalGroup`s in impact order (the current `REPORT_ORDER`), then the empty state.
- `ReportSummary { report, counts }`: the "What changed" summary in `--text-reading`, plus the model name, counts and the dropped-for-evidence notice.
- `ProposalGroup { category, proposals }`: heading with the category label and count. It can be collapsed.
- `ProposalCard { proposal, target, onJump, onStatus, onEdit }`: see §6.6 for the anatomy. Its states are pending, accepted, rejected and applied.
- `FieldDiff { label, before, after }`: `due  ~~Nov 1~~ → Nov 20`.
- `EvidenceQuote { quote, speaker, t, onJump }`: a real `<button>`. It has a 2 px left rail in the speaker's colour and shows the quote in the reading style, not italic, because italic Geist is a synthesized slant. The `— Speaker · 12:04` caption is below the quote. On hover or focus it shows a "Show in transcript" hint.
- `ReviewBar`: sticky at the bottom of the report pane. It shows a progress bar (`7 of 9 reviewed`), the "Accept all firm" button (with the existing rules: firm, confidence ≥ 0.7, never close/supersede) and the primary "Apply 5 changes" button. It's always in the same place.
- `SkippedChangesBanner`, `EditProposalDialog`, `SpeakerMapDialog` (with `Avatar` and a stakeholder combobox via `datalist`), `RenameMeetingDialog` (or inline title edit).

**Recording** (`features/recording/`)
- `useRecordingController()`: **all recording logic extracted unchanged from `App.tsx`**: start, stop, mark, hotkeys, `meeting:ended`, `app:quit-requested`, `setRecordingState`.
- `RecordingPill`: a pulsing dot, the title (truncated), a timer in mono tabular, a Mark moment `IconButton` (star, with Kbd tooltip), and Stop (`record` variant, sm).
- `StartRecordingDialog`: project select and title. It includes the consent note as an info `Banner`, not muted small text.
- `DetectedMeetingBanner`.
- `recorder.ts`: moved here, unchanged.

**Stakeholders** (`features/stakeholders/`)
- `StakeholderTable`: Avatar, Name, Role and Email, with a row overflow → Remove.
- `AddStakeholderForm`: an inline row of three inputs and an Add button. Enter submits.

**History** (`features/history/`)
- `HistoryTimeline`: vertical timeline grouped by date.
- `VersionCard`: meeting title (a link to open it) or "Manual change", the date, the change count, and `ChangeRow`s.
- `ChangeRow`: `OpBadge`, `ItemTypeBadge`, the title, and `FieldDiff`s for updates.

**Settings** (`features/settings/`)
- `SettingsNav`.
- `ModelSection`: `RadioCardGroup` of providers, model `Input`, base URL, `SecretInput`, the Test connection button with its result `Banner`, and "Remove saved key".
- `TranscriptionSection`.
- `RecordingSection`: self name, chunk length, detection `Switch`, and hotkeys.
- `AppearanceSection`: a new theme `SegmentedControl` with System / Light / Dark.
- A sticky save footer that appears when the form is dirty.

**Onboarding** (`features/onboarding/`)
- `WelcomePage`: the hero (`--text-display`), a three-step explainer ("Add what you know → Record or import a meeting → Review what changed") and the "Create your first project" CTA.
- `SetupChecklist`: shared with `SetupCard`.

### 4.4 Hooks and lib

- `hooks/`: `useAction` (unchanged semantics), `useEvent`, `useTick`, `useTheme`, `useMediaQuery`, `useConfirm`, `useToast`, `useHotkey` (in-window shortcuts, §8.2).
- `lib/`: `clickable` (kept for the rare non-button case), `format` (re-exports `@shared/format`, `fmtDate`), `speakerColor`, `labels` (the `OP_*` and `STATUS_*` maps now duplicated across files, collected in one place).

**Dependency rules** (written down now; they could be enforced later with Biome `noRestrictedImports`):
- `components/ui` imports nothing from `features`, `pages`, `api` or `@shared/types`.
- `components/domain` may import `@shared/types` and `ui`, but not `api`.
- `features/*` may import `ui`, `domain`, `layout`, `hooks`, `lib` and `api`, but never another feature's internals. If two features need something, it moves into `domain` or `lib`.
- `pages/*` compose features and own no data fetching beyond the route params.

### 5.1 Styling: Tailwind CSS v4

**Decision:** Tailwind CSS v4 with the design tokens from §2, and `class-variance-authority` for component variants. This is the common enterprise React stack (as in shadcn/ui), and it is feasible here: `@tailwindcss/vite` 4.3 supports Vite 5–8, so it works with the Vite 7 that electron-vite 5 requires.

**New dependencies** (devDependencies, since everything is bundled at build time):

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/vite` | Utility CSS, compiled at build time |
| `class-variance-authority` | Typed variant definitions |
| `clsx`, `tailwind-merge` | `cn()`: conditional classes, with later utilities overriding earlier ones |
| `lucide-react` | Icons |
| `@fontsource-variable/geist`, `@fontsource-variable/geist-mono` | Bundled fonts |

None has an install script, so npm 11's install-script blocking (see CLAUDE.md) doesn't affect them. Pin exact minor ranges as the rest of `package.json` does.

**Setup:**
- `electron.vite.config.ts`: add `tailwindcss()` to `renderer.plugins` next to `react()`. Main and preload are untouched.
- `main.tsx` imports `styles/index.css` once. Tailwind v4 needs no `tailwind.config.js` or PostCSS config: content detection is automatic, and configuration lives in CSS (`@theme`).
- **CSP:** Tailwind outputs one static stylesheet, which `style-src 'self'` already allows. Dynamic values (a speaker's colour, a progress percentage) use CSS variables set through the `style` prop (`style={{ '--speaker': … }}`), which the existing `'unsafe-inline'` permits.
- **Vitest:** jsdom tests don't need the CSS. Class names are only strings there, and tests query by role, not by class.

**Biome:**
- Enable `css.parser.tailwindDirectives: true` so Biome parses `@theme`, `@apply`, `@variant` and `@custom-variant` instead of reporting them as errors.
- Enable the `nursery/useSortedClasses` rule (with `cn` and `cva` listed as functions) so class order is consistent and diffs are small, as Prettier's Tailwind plugin does elsewhere. It is a nursery rule, so if it proves noisy we keep it as a warning.
- The existing CSS formatter stays disabled for the old hand-compacted `styles.css` only. New CSS files are formatted.

**Rules for writing classes:**
1. Only semantic token utilities: `bg-surface`, `text-fg-secondary`, `border-line`, `rounded-xl`, `shadow-xs`, `text-title`. Arbitrary values (`w-[37px]`, `bg-[#fff]`) need a comment explaining why. Raw palette classes don't exist (`--color-*: initial`).
2. Dark mode is automatic through the tokens, so `dark:` utilities should be rare: only when a component needs a *structurally* different dark treatment.
3. Variants belong in `cva`, not in ternaries inside JSX.
4. `@apply` is used only in `base.css` (for element defaults such as `body` and `:focus-visible`), never to rebuild a component as a CSS class.
5. Motion uses the §2.9 tokens and the `motion-safe:` / `motion-reduce:` variants. The easings are Tailwind `--ease-*` theme variables (`ease-out`, `ease-in`, `ease-standard`). Tailwind has no duration theme namespace, so `theme.css` defines four small `@utility` classes (`duration-instant`, `duration-fast`, `duration-base`, `duration-slow`) that read `--dur-*`.
6. Responsive classes use our breakpoints, redefined in `@theme` as `--breakpoint-regular: 1100px` and `--breakpoint-wide: 1440px`. Compact (900–1099 px, the window's minimum) is the unprefixed default. Tailwind's defaults (`sm`, `md`, `lg`…) are removed so nobody uses phone-oriented breakpoints by accident.

**Example:**

```ts
// components/ui/Button/button.variants.ts
export const buttonVariants = cva(
  'inline-flex items-center justify-center gap-2 rounded-md text-body-strong whitespace-nowrap transition-colors duration-fast ' +
    'focus-visible:shadow-focus disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:bg-disabled disabled:text-fg-disabled active:translate-y-px',
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        primary: 'bg-accent text-fg-inverse hover:bg-accent-hover',
        secondary: 'border border-line-strong bg-surface text-fg shadow-xs hover:bg-hover',
        soft: 'bg-accent-soft text-accent-fg hover:bg-accent-soft/80',
        ghost: 'text-fg hover:bg-selected',
        danger: 'border border-danger-line bg-surface text-danger-fg hover:bg-danger-soft',
        'danger-soft': 'bg-danger-soft text-danger-fg hover:bg-danger-soft/70',
        record: 'bg-record-solid text-white hover:bg-record-solid/90'
      },
      size: { sm: 'h-8 px-3', md: 'h-9 px-3.5', lg: 'h-10 px-4' }
    },
    defaultVariants: { variant: 'secondary', size: 'md' }
  }
)
```

## 6. Screen-by-screen plan

Each screen lists its route (the existing `View` union, unchanged), components and Figma mapping.

### 6.1 Welcome (`{ kind: 'home' }`, no projects yet)
- **Layout:** AppShell (Sidebar with an empty Projects section and an "Add project" ghost row) and a centred `WelcomePage`.
- **Content:**
  - Brand mark and a `--text-display` headline: "See what changed in your project, meeting by meeting."
  - A three-step explainer with icons.
  - Primary lg "Create your first project".
  - `SetupChecklist` below it: AI model key ☐, Speech-to-text ☐, Your name ☐. Each item links to its Settings section.
- **Figma:** the cover's "Explore MeetMind" and "Personal Assistant" cards become the three step cards. The sidebar's upgrade card becomes the `SetupCard`.

### 6.2 Project › State board (`{ kind: 'project', tab: 'board' }`, the default)
- **Header:** `PageHeader` with the project name, the description (2-line clamp with "More"), and actions: secondary "Edit project" and `CaptureMenu` (which also stays in the TopBar).
- **Then:** `ProjectSummaryStrip` (3 `Stat` cards), then `Tabs` (State · Meetings · Stakeholders · History), each with a count.
- **Toolbar:** the "N open items" explainer on the left; a "Show done & superseded" `Switch` on the right.
- **Body:** `StateBoard` → 6 `BoardColumn`s → `ItemCard`s. Clicking a card or "+" opens the `ItemDialog` popup.
- **Loading:** `Skeleton.Card` × 2 per column.
- **Empty column:** a one-line hint ("No decisions yet") plus "+ Add". When the whole board is empty, a single `EmptyState` above the columns: "Add what you already know, or record a meeting to start."
- **Figma:** the stat cards from the dashboard thumbnail (`$124,500 · $38,200…` row) become the summary strip. The kit's Tab Menu becomes the tabs. Its card style (white, hairline, 12 px radius) is used for the columns.

### 6.3 Project › Meetings
- **Toolbar:** count on the left; `CaptureMenu` on the right (Record · Paste transcript · Import transcript file · Import recording). Import progress shows as a `loading` button plus a toast when it finishes.
- **Body:** `MeetingTable`. A row with `analyzed` status shows a warning "Needs review" badge and sorts to the top of a "Needs your review" group. A row with an error shows a danger icon whose tooltip is `meeting.error`.
- **Empty:** `EmptyState` (mic icon) with "Record meeting" and "Import transcript".
- **Figma:** the meetings table thumbnail (title, date, participants, status badge, row actions) becomes `MeetingTable`. We drop pagination and participant avatars, since we have no participant data per meeting.

### 6.4 Project › Stakeholders
- **Body:** a reading column with an intro line, `AddStakeholderForm` and `StakeholderTable`.
- **Empty:** `EmptyState` saying stakeholders improve attribution, with focus moved to the Name input.
- **Figma:** the Table Component and Avatar.

### 6.5 Project › Change history
- **Body:** a reading column with `HistoryTimeline`. Date groups ("Today", "Oct 3") contain `VersionCard`s. Each card links to its meeting.
- **Empty:** `EmptyState`: "No approved changes yet. Analyze a meeting and apply its report."
- **Figma:** the activity and recent-meetings list styling.

### 6.6 Meeting (`{ kind: 'meeting' }`): the core screen

```

- The left rail colour shows the status: neutral = pending, success = accepted, danger = rejected (the card is also dimmed and its title struck through), info = applied (actions are replaced by an "Applied to project" badge).
- Accept and Reject are toggle buttons with `aria-pressed`.
- **Live state** (while recording this meeting):
  - The header badge becomes record-toned "Live" with a pulse.
  - The transcript shows "Listening… lines appear about every N seconds" with a subtle pulsing waveform icon.
  - The report pane shows `EmptyState`: "The report is generated when the meeting ends."
- **Processing** (`transcribing` / `analyzing`): the stepper's current step spins. The report pane shows `Skeleton` proposal cards and the label "Comparing this meeting with the project state…".
- **Compact width:** `SplitPane` becomes Tabs (Transcript · Impact report, with counts). Clicking an evidence quote switches to the Transcript tab and highlights the line.
- **Figma:** the meeting-detail thumbnail (transcript list beside AI notes, with a player bar) becomes the split view. The kit's "AI summary" card becomes `ReportSummary`. Badges use the kit's soft-outline style.

### 6.7 Settings (`{ kind: 'settings' }`)
- **Layout:** `PageHeader` "Settings", then `SettingsNav` (AI model · Transcription · Recording & hotkeys · Appearance) and a reading-column form. The nav scroll-spies the sections.
- **Provider choice:** `RadioCardGroup`, with a "Key saved" success badge per provider.
- **Saving:** a sticky footer appears when the form is dirty: "Unsaved changes", then [Discard] [Save changes]. "Test connection" stays inline in its section, and its result shows in a `Banner`.
- **Figma:** the Settings thumbnail (left sub-nav "General / Meeting Settings / Notifications…" plus form rows) becomes `SettingsNav` and the sections. The Integrations card grid becomes the provider `RadioCardGroup`.

### 6.8 Dialogs and overlays (all screens)

| Today | New |
|---|---|
| `NewProjectModal` | `NewProjectDialog` (md) |
| `EditProjectModal` | `EditProjectDialog` (md); delete is a danger zone and uses `ConfirmDialog` |
| `ItemModal` | `ItemDialog` (popup, lg, with the history section) |
| `StartRecordingModal` | `StartRecordingDialog` (sm) |
| `PasteTranscriptModal` | `PasteTranscriptDialog` (lg) |
| `EditProposalModal` | `EditProposalDialog` (md), primary "Save & accept" |
| `SpeakerMapModal` | `SpeakerMapDialog` (md) |
| `RenameModal` | Inline editable title in `PageHeader`; a dialog only as the fallback |
| `confirm()` × 5 | `ConfirmDialog` |
| `banner` string | `Toast`s, and the `DetectedMeetingBanner` in the BannerStack |
| Red `recbar` | `RecordingPill` in the TopBar |

---

## 7. Interaction and motion

**Principles:** motion explains a change of state or place. It is never decorative, it never delays input, and everything except the recording pulse respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

| Interaction | Motion |
|---|---|
| Button/row hover | Background/border colour change, `--dur-fast`, `--ease-standard` |
| Button press | `translateY(0.5px)`, `--dur-instant` |
| Focus ring | Appears instantly. No animation, so it is never late. |
| Menu / tooltip / popover | Fade plus 4 px slide from the anchor, `--dur-base` `--ease-out`; exit `--dur-fast` `--ease-in` |
| Dialog | Backdrop fades; panel fades and scales `.98 → 1`, `--dur-slow` `--ease-out` |
| Toast | Slides up 8 px and fades; the stack reflows with a `--dur-base` transform |
| Tab change | Underline indicator slides to the new tab (`--dur-base`); panel content swaps without animation |
| Proposal accept | Left rail colour transitions to success and the check icon scales `0.8 → 1` (`--dur-base`). The card **does not move or reorder** (stable positions are critical in a review queue). |
| Proposal reject | Card dims to 60% opacity and the title strike-through draws, `--dur-base` |
| Apply changes | The button shows loading. On success, accepted cards change to "Applied" one after another (30 ms stagger, max 300 ms total), then a toast says "4 changes applied · View project state". |
| Evidence jump | Transcript smooth-scrolls (`block: center`). The line flashes a warning-soft background held for 1.2 s, then fades over 800 ms. Reduced motion: instant scroll and static highlight. |
| Live transcript append | New lines fade in (opacity, `--dur-base`). Auto-scroll only if the user is at the bottom; otherwise a "Jump to latest ↓" pill fades in. |
| Recording dot | Opacity pulse 1 → .35, 1.2 s, infinite. **Kept under reduced motion** at a slower 2 s, because it is a status signal: it is marked `data-essential-motion`, which `base.css` exempts from its reduced-motion reset. The "Recording" text label is always present too. |
| Mark moment | The star icon pops (scale 1 → 1.25 → 1) and a toast "Marked 12:04" appears |
| Board item saved | The changed card gets a 1 s accent-soft background fade |

**Loading and skeletons.** These rules replace today's `if (!x) return null`.
- **First load of a page:** skeletons that match the final layout. They use `--color-selected` blocks with a 1.4 s linear shimmer gradient, or a static block under reduced motion.
  - Board: column headers plus 2 card skeletons each.
  - Meetings: 5 row skeletons.
  - Meeting: header skeleton, 8 transcript-line skeletons, 3 proposal-card skeletons.
- **Refetch after `meeting:changed`:** don't skeleton. Keep the stale content and swap it in place, to avoid flicker.
- **Skeleton delay:** only show skeletons if loading takes more than 150 ms, to avoid flashing on fast local SQLite reads.
- **Long background work** (transcribing, analyzing): the `PipelineStepper` spinner plus a toast when done (main already sends a notification).
- **Button actions:** `loading` on the triggering button through `useAction().busy`. The rest of the page stays usable unless the action would conflict; for example, Apply is disabled while analyzing, as it is today.

## 8. Accessibility

Target: **WCAG 2.2 AA**.

### 8.1 Contrast

- **Text:** ≥ 4.5:1 for normal text and ≥ 3:1 for text ≥ 18.66 px bold / 24 px regular.
- **Non-text:** icons that carry meaning, focus rings, the selected indicator, input borders in their focus state and toggle tracks need ≥ 3:1.
- Key pairs (approximate; verified by an automated test, below):

| Pair | Ratio | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-fg` `#111` on `#fff` / `#f9f9f9` | ~18.9 / ~17.9 | ✅ |
| `--color-fg-secondary` `#575757` on `#fff` | ~7.0 | ✅ |
| `--color-fg-tertiary` `#696e6e` on `#f9f9f9` | ~4.9 | ✅ |
| Kit Text/disabled `#717676` on `#f9f9f9` | ~4.4 | ❌, hence the derived gray-600 |
| White on `--color-accent` `#007e4b` | ~5.1 | ✅ |
| White on kit primary `#009d5e` | ~3.5 | ❌ for text; used for non-text only |
| `--color-focus` `#009d5e` vs `#fff` | ~3.5 | ✅ (non-text 3:1) |
| Red text `#9e2a2a` on red-soft `#f9ebeb` | ~6.9 | ✅ |
| Yellow text `#5f4314` on yellow-soft `#fff8ec` | ~8.9 | ✅ |
| Kit Badge/success `#46a983` on its shade | ~2.9 | ❌, hence the derived green text `#1f6b4e` |

- **Automated check:** add `test/renderer/contrast.test.ts`. It parses `tokens.css` for both themes and asserts a list of foreground/background pairs (every `*-fg` on its `*-soft`, `fg` tokens on `canvas`/`surface`, inverse on `accent` and the solids). A token edit that breaks AA then fails CI. *Derived* hex values in §2.1 may be nudged by this test during implementation.
- **Input borders:** at rest, `#d4d4d4` is below 3:1. This is acceptable because every field has a visible label and a filled surface. Hover and focus states meet 3:1. In Windows High Contrast (`forced-colors: active`), all borders use `CanvasText`/`Highlight`, and the custom focus ring becomes `outline: 2px solid Highlight`.
- **Colour is never the only signal:** every status and category badge has a text label; proposal state uses the rail colour plus an icon, `aria-pressed` and a text badge; due-date urgency adds "Overdue" text.

### 8.2 Keyboard navigation

- **Everything is reachable by Tab in visual order.** Clickable things are `<button>` elements; `clickable()` stays only as a last resort.
- **Skip link:** "Skip to content" is the first focusable element and jumps to `<main>`.
- **Landmarks:** `<nav aria-label="Projects">` (sidebar), `<header>` (TopBar), `<main>`, and `role="region"` with `aria-label` on the Transcript and Impact report panes.
- **Composite widgets** use WAI-ARIA patterns with roving tabindex: Tabs (←/→, Home/End), Menu (↑/↓, typeahead, Esc), RadioCardGroup (arrow keys), SegmentedControl.
- **Dialogs:** native `<dialog>` modal focus containment. Initial focus goes to the first field (or Cancel for destructive confirms). Esc closes unless saving. Focus returns to the trigger.
- **In-app shortcuts** (`useHotkey`). They are inactive while typing in an input or a dialog is open, and listed in a "Keyboard shortcuts" dialog opened with `?`.

  | Key | Action |
  |---|---|
  | `J` / `K` | Next / previous proposal (Impact report) |
  | `A` / `R` / `E` | Accept / reject / edit the focused proposal |
  | `T` | Jump to the evidence of the focused proposal |
  | `N` | New item (board) |
  | `Ctrl+,` | Settings |

  Global hotkeys (record, mark) stay as they are, configured in main.

### 8.3 Focus styles

- One ring everywhere: `box-shadow: var(--shadow-focus)`, which is a 2 px surface gap and then a 2 px `--color-focus` ring, applied on `:focus-visible` only.
- Inside tight containers, such as a full-width transcript line, use an inset version (`inset 0 0 0 2px var(--color-focus)`).
- Never `outline: none` without a replacement. `base.css` sets `:focus:not(:focus-visible) { outline: none }`, and that is the only removal.
- Focus must never be obscured by the sticky `ReviewBar` or TopBar (WCAG 2.2 SC 2.4.11). The scroll containers use `scroll-padding-bottom` equal to the ReviewBar height.

### 8.4 Screen readers and semantics

- Live regions:
  - The toast region is `role="status"` (errors use `role="alert"`).
  - The recording timer is *not* live, which would be too chatty. Only start and stop are announced.
  - New transcript lines are not announced. The "Jump to latest" pill is announced politely.
- `aria-busy` on regions that are loading. Spinners have labels ("Analyzing meeting").
- Buttons with only icons always have `aria-label`. Toggle buttons use `aria-pressed`. The active nav item uses `aria-current="page"`.
- Evidence quotes are buttons labelled "Show in transcript: ‘…quote…’, Rahul at 0:31".
- **Target size:** the minimum is 24×24 px (WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8); the default control is 36 px and the smallest is 32 px.
- Text resizes to 200% without loss (rem-based type; layouts reflow rather than clip).

---

## 9. Migration plan

**Goal:** replace the UI incrementally. **After every step:**
- `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` and `npm run check` pass.
- The app runs (`npm run dev`, or against throwaway data with `--user-data-dir`).
- Recording, analysis and apply still work end to end.

Each step is one PR on its own branch.

**Test strategy throughout:**
- Renderer tests currently find elements by text and `.modal`, for example `'✓ Accept'`. When the matching component is replaced, they move to role-based queries: `getByRole('dialog')`, `getByRole('button', { name: 'Accept' })`. That makes them robust to the redesign.
- Behaviour assertions (errors shown, input kept on failure, no double submit) must not change.
- New primitives get focused tests (Dialog focus return, Tabs keyboard, Button loading/disabled, ConfirmDialog resolution).

**Step 0. Foundations: Tailwind, tokens, fonts and the theme setting** (no change to component structure)
1. Install the §5.1 dependencies. Add `tailwindcss()` to the renderer plugins. Add `styles/index.css`, `tokens.css`, `theme.css` and `base.css`, and import them from `main.tsx`. Turn on Biome's `tailwindDirectives`.
2. **Coexistence with the old CSS:**
   - Tailwind puts its preflight reset and its utilities in cascade layers (`@layer base`, `@layer utilities`).
   - The legacy `styles.css` stays **unlayered**, and unlayered CSS always beats layered CSS. Old screens therefore keep their look exactly, and preflight can't break them.
   - New components use only utilities, never the old classes, so the two don't interfere.
3. **Re-point the legacy variables** in `styles.css` (`--bg`, `--panel`, `--accent`…) at the new semantic tokens, and set the body font to Geist. The existing UI immediately picks up the new palette, font and light/dark support with no JSX changes.
4. **Theme setting (System, the default; Light; Dark):**
   - Add `theme: 'system' | 'light' | 'dark'` to `Settings` in `src/shared/types.ts`, defaulting to `'system'`.
   - Add `theme: z.enum(['system', 'light', 'dark'])` to `SETTINGS_FIELDS` in `ipc.ts`. An existing `settings.json` without the key falls back to the default, because unknown or invalid values already do.
   - In `index.ts`, apply `nativeTheme.themeSource` at startup and whenever settings are saved, and create the `BrowserWindow` with `backgroundColor` matching `nativeTheme.shouldUseDarkColors` (no launch flash).
   - Extend `settings.test.ts` (default value, invalid value falls back) and add a small test that saving the setting updates `themeSource`.
   - Until the Settings page is rebuilt in Step 3, the old Settings view gets a temporary three-option select for the theme.
5. Add `contrast.test.ts`.

*Risk:* low. These are the only main-process and shared-type edits in the whole migration. *Checkpoint:* the app looks restyled in both themes, switching Windows between light and dark updates it live under "System", and everything still works.

**Step 1. Primitives library**
- Build `components/ui` and `components/domain`, plus the `hooks/` and `lib/` moves: `useAction`, `useEvent` and `useTick` move unchanged, and `ui.tsx` re-exports from the new locations so existing imports keep working.
- Add tests per primitive.
- Not yet used by any screen, except swapping `Modal` → `Dialog` behind the same `Modal` API, so all existing dialogs gain focus trapping now.

*Risk:* low.

**Step 2. App shell and recording extraction**
1. Extract `useRecordingController` out of `App.tsx` **with no behaviour change**. Add a renderer test for start → stop → navigate-to-meeting with a fake recorder, run before and after the extraction.
2. Introduce `AppShell`, `Sidebar` (with the rail), `TopBar` (`CaptureMenu`, `RecordingPill`), `BannerStack`, `ToastRegion` and `ConfirmProvider`. Replace the `banner` string with toasts.
3. The old page components render unchanged inside the new shell.

*Risk:* medium, because recording state is the riskiest logic. *Checkpoint:* a manual recording with Teams/Zoom (detect → record → mark → stop → transcribe → analyze), plus a quit-while-recording check.

**Step 3. Settings page**
- Rebuild it as `SettingsPage` with sections, `RadioCardGroup`, `SecretInput`, the sticky save footer and and the Appearance section: a System / Light / Dark `SegmentedControl` bound to the `theme` setting from Step 0. The temporary select is removed.

*Risk:* low. It's self-contained, and `settings.test`/`views.test` cover it.

**Step 4. Project pages**, one sub-step per tab, in this order:
1. `ProjectPage` with `PageHeader`, `Tabs`, `ProjectSummaryStrip`, and `EditProjectDialog` using `ConfirmDialog`.
2. History: read-only, so the lowest risk.
3. Stakeholders.
4. Meetings: `MeetingTable` and the `CaptureMenu` import actions.
5. State board: `StateBoard`, `ItemCard`, `ItemDialog` (replacing `ItemModal`).

After each sub-step, delete the matching function from `ProjectView.tsx`. When it is empty, delete the file.

**Step 5. Meeting page**, the most important and the most complex screen. In this order:
1. `MeetingHeader`, `PipelineStepper` and the banners.
2. `TranscriptPane` / `TranscriptLine`, including live append and the "Jump to latest" pill.
3. `ImpactReport`, `ReportSummary`, `ProposalGroup`, `ProposalCard`, `EvidenceQuote` and `FieldDiff`.
4. `ReviewBar`, keeping the "Accept all firm" exclusion of close/supersede, with a test asserting it.
5. The dialogs, and `SplitPane` compact tabs.
6. Proposal keyboard shortcuts.

`test/pipeline.test.ts` doesn't touch the renderer. The `views.test.tsx` meeting cases are updated to role queries in the same PR. *Checkpoint:* analyze → accept/edit/reject → apply → skipped-changes path, on a seeded database.

**Step 6. Welcome and onboarding**
- `WelcomePage` and `SetupChecklist`/`SetupCard`.

**Step 7. Cleanup and audit**
- Delete `styles.css`, the legacy variables, `ui.tsx` re-exports, `.text-btn` and the other old classes. Re-enable Biome's CSS formatter for all files, and drop the "hand-compacted styles.css" exception from `biome.jsonc`.
- Check for stray arbitrary values (`-[`) and `dark:` overrides, and justify or remove each.
- Grep for `window.confirm`, `title=` used as the only explanation, and hard-coded colours. Add Biome `noRestrictedImports` for the folder rules.
- Run an accessibility pass: keyboard-only walk-through of every screen, Windows Narrator smoke test, forced-colors check, both themes at 900 px and 1440 px.
- Update `CLAUDE.md`'s "Renderer conventions" for the new structure (Tailwind + `cva` rules, Button/Dialog/useConfirm/useToast, folder rules, the `theme` setting).

**Later (not part of this migration):**
- A quick switcher (`Ctrl+K`), inspired by the kit's search field. It needs a cross-project meetings query.
- A cross-project "Needs review" inbox on Home.
- An audio player in the transcript pane, which would need an api to stream the `.webm`.

## 10. Decisions

Agreed in review on 2026-10-08:

1. **Theme:** System (default), Light and Dark, stored as the `theme` setting and applied through `nativeTheme.themeSource` (§2, Step 0).
2. **Icons and fonts:** `lucide-react`, and Geist / Geist Mono through `@fontsource-variable` (§2.3, §4.1).
3. **Project sections** are page tabs (State · Meetings · Stakeholders · History), not sidebar sub-items (§3, §6.2).
4. **Editing an item** opens a popup dialog (`ItemDialog`) with the history inside it, not a side drawer (§4.3).
5. **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 with `class-variance-authority`, `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`, on top of the token layer (§5.1).
6. **Main-process changes:** approved, and limited to the theme setting and the window background colour (Step 0).
